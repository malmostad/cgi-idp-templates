            <h1>Contact &amp; support</h1>
            <p>There are several issuers of electronic identification (e-ID) and the most common way
                to obtain one is to contact your bank. If you have Online Banking you can easily get
                an e-ID as a file to download to your computer. Another option is to get an e-ID on
                a card, and some issuers can even provide an e-ID for your mobile phone.</p>
            <p>To be able to get a Swedish e-ID you need to have a Swedish personal identity number,
                and be in the Swedish population register. If you are not registered for population
                purposes in Sweden the process is more difficult and you will need to speak to your
                bank.</p>
            <p>If you are under 18, a guardian’s consent is needed and you will have to visit the
                bank or Skatteverket’s office together to get an e-ID. You also have to visit the
                bank or Skatteverket to get an e-ID if your identity is protected.</p>
            <p>Different issuers of e-IDs may have different fees. An e-ID as a computer file is
                usually free, while an e-ID on a card usually cost money. The card may also be used
                as a physical form of ID.</p>
            <h2>To block your e-ID</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>An electronic identification (e-ID) is a personal form of identification that you
                should keep safe. Your PIN should also be kept a secret. If you suspect that an
                unauthorized person has, or have had, access to your e-ID – or if you have lost it –
                you should immediately get it blocked so it no longer can be used.</p>
            <p>If your e-ID is a file on your computer or on your mobile phone, you can usually log
                in to your Online Banking account and block it yourself. If you cannot log in to
                your bank, or if your e-ID is on a card, you have to call your issuer to get it
                blocked.</p>
            <p>A stolen or lost ID card should be reported to the police. Call 114 14 (if you are in
                Sweden) or file a report online at www.polisen.se.</p>
            <h2>Test your e-ID</h2>
            <p>The issuer of your e-ID is responsible for support and help with the software needed
                on your computer. On these websites you can test if your e-ID is working, and you
                can also install or update the necessary security software.</p>

            <h2>What is an e-ID</h2>
            <p>An e-ID is an electronic form of identification that you can use to identify yourself
                on the Internet, in the same way a driving license or an ID card is used when
                identifying yourself in person.</p>
            <p>You can sign documents electronically via the Internet with an e-ID. It is as legally
                binding as if you sign the document with a pen on paper. Having an e-ID makes it
                easier for you to use the different online services many government agencies,
                municipalities and companies provide.</p>
            <p>You can have your e-ID as a file on your computer or on a so-called smart card. Some
                issuers can provide an e-ID for your mobile phone.</p>
            <p>Using an e-ID makes it easier to use services at many different governments,
                municipalities and companies over the Internet.</p>
            <h2>Where do I get support?</h2>
            <p>You should contact your issuer for help if you have trouble getting your e-ID to
                work. The issuer is usually your bank. If you have an e-ID as a file but cannot get
                it to work at the test website, you can try downloading a new one from your Online
                Banking account. Do not forget to block the old one!</p>
            <p>If you cannot get an e-service to work, but your e-ID is working on the test website,
                you should contact the government agency or company that provides the e-service.</p>
